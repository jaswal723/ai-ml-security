# ⚙️ Phase 1 — Automation Baseline & Data Engineering

**AI/ML Security Architect: 12-Month Transformation Roadmap**

---

## 🎯 Goal

Establish a strong foundation in **data movement, transformation, and standardization** — the backbone of any AI-powered security system.

By the end of this phase, you’ll be able to:

* Efficiently handle structured and unstructured data (logs, CSVs, JSONs, APIs)
* Build automated data pipelines for security operations
* Normalize data formats across multiple platforms (EDR, Firewall, SOAR)
* Log, validate, and export information cleanly for downstream ML or automation tasks

## 🧠 Learning Overview

| Week | Focus Area                      | Key Concepts                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | File Handling & JSON            | Read/write local data safely; parse logs and reports    |
| 2    | APIs & Threat Intelligence      | Interact with external APIs (Threat Feeds, EDRs)        |
| 3    | Data Transformation with Pandas | Process massive datasets efficiently                    |
| 4    | Defensive Programming           | Error handling, logging, and production-ready scripting |

## 🧩 Week 1 — File Handling & JSON

### **Goal:**

Move security data between disk and Python cleanly — no more “manual parsing.”

---

## 🌐 Week 2 — Interacting with the Outside World (APIs)

### **Goal:**

Use Python to **pull live threat intelligence** and interact with external SaaS platforms.

---

## 🧮 Week 3 — Data Transformation with Pandas

### **Goal:**

Master **Pandas**, the library that replaces 100 lines of loops with 5 lines of elegant data manipulation.
Learn to handle logs, asset inventories, and alerts at scale.

---

## 🧱 Week 4 — Defensive Programming & Logging

### **Goal:**

Learn to build **resilient, production-grade scripts** that never crash silently.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1 Capstone Project — “Security Data Pipeline”

**Goal:**
Integrate everything you learned — from file I/O to API automation — into a working **data ingestion and normalization system**.

---

## 🧩 Completion Criteria

You’ve successfully completed Phase 1 when you can:

* Build a Python script that reads, transforms, and exports data reliably
* Write CSV/JSON logs automatically
* Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
* Produce normalized security data usable by a SIEM or ML model
* Log all major script events with timestamps
